# AI Resume Screening & Ranking System

This project is an AI-powered resume screening and ranking system built using Streamlit, scikit-learn, and PyPDF2. The application allows users to upload resumes in PDF format, compare them to a given job description, and rank them based on cosine similarity using TF-IDF.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload multiple PDF resumes.
- Enter a job description to compare.
- Uses TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity for ranking.
- Displays ranked resumes with similarity scores.
